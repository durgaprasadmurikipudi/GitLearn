There are 2 Source Control Systems:
Centralised and Decentralised.
Centralised, require a connection to central server for all the soruce control operations to be performed.
Decentralised: does allow all operations to be performed on local. And the n whenever you can connect to
server, you can sync all these things.

Key concepts:
Repository: IT contails all original files of the project that we want to backup and also the history of
changes that we did to the project.
3 Stages of GIT:
Working area: Where we work on the changes to be made to the project.
Staging area: Place where we queue up all of our changes that are part of
 the next commit without affect git change history.
Repository/Commit/History: Once commited all our changes, these become a permanent member of the
change part of the repository. Technically these all stored in the .git folder in the same Place
as of working area.
MAster Branch: This is the main branch where all the original project and all the commited changed
to the original repository reside. This is a default one created by GIT when we first opt it 
for version controlling by GIT.

Setting up GIT:
We need to configure our name and email address in GIT, before we can commit any to local repository.

git config --global user.name "durga prasad"
git config --global user.email "durgaprasadmurikipudi@gmail.com"

To see what we have configured, we can use below command:

git config --global --list

Git clone command creates a branch master here in local and also adds a direct reference to origin/master in the remote repository
that we are trying to clone.

If there exists a local repository and you want to add a remote repository to this local one, you can issue below command..
git remote add <the_Remote_branch_name> <the_Remote_repository_url>
